# MulProx4x4
This project implements a 4Ã—4 Approximate Multiplier in Verilog, designed using approximate half adders, full adders, and a 4:2 compressor to optimize for low power, reduced area, and faster computation. The multiplioer is ideal for error-tolerant applications like image processing, machine learing and signal processing.
